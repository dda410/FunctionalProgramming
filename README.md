# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING (X_401011)

## Overview

The objective of this course is to obtain basic knowledge of
functional programming (using Haskell) and its foundations via
lambda-calculus and equational reasoning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
  
- __Ass1, Ass2, Ass3__: contains the source code and files relative
  to each assignment. The specification of each implemented function
  are written in comments in the source code. To run the programs call
  the Glasgow Haskell Compiler in interactive mode as follows `ghci
  program.hs` and then call the desired function in the command
  prompt.
